# Investor Bulletin Project
## Objectives

You will create a simple API using FastAPI (python web framework), events published & consumed through RabbitMQ, and background tasks managed by Celery to sync stock market data and provide threshold alerting based on user interests.

## Project Context

Stock investments provide one of the highest returns in the market. Even though they are volatile in nature, one can visualize share prices and other statistical factors, which helps keen investors carefully decide on which company they want to spend their earnings on.

This project will allow users to retrieve the latest stock market prices and create alert rules by setting a threshold price for the stock they are interested in and receiving alerts if stocks cross those thresholds.
